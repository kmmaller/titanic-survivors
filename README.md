Titanic Survivors
-----------------------

Using machine learning techniques to predict the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic. This notebook gets a score >80%

This is a good introduction into basic machine learning techniques and is usually everyone's first introduction to kaggle.

Data is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

This Notebook produces a submission.csv file per kaggle instructions.
